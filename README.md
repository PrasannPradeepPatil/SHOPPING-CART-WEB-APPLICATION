# WEB-APPLICATION
***ABOUT THE PROJECT***  
Created a simple application with 2 activities    
**ACTIVITY1**    
Activity 1 has images and text views embedded in a recycler view. You can select an image and move to the next activity.    

**ACTIVITY2**     
The images and text selected in Activity1 appear in Activity 2.   
Now you can copy the text , download the image , share the image with other people , update the text in activity2 which will also be reflected in activity 1          

***RUNNING THE PROJECT***  
You can either install Android studio and then go to build  to produce the .apk which can run on an emulator in android studio  or your device in debug mode.    
OR 
IF YOU DONT WANT TO RUN THE APP AND JUST SEE SCREENSHOTS  You can see the applications in **ApplicationScreenShots** Folder.
