# WEB-APPLICATION
***ABOUT THE PROJECT***  
This is a simple DJANGO web application that I build to learn Django. It has 1 application called products and the admin app is used to manage my models.

**ACTIVITY2**     
The images and text selected in Activity1 appear in Activity 2.   
Now you can copy the text , download the image , share the image with other people , update the text in activity2 which will also be reflected in activity 1          

***RUNNING THE PROJECT***  
You can  open this folder in your editor  and in terminal window run  python manage.py runserver on windows and python3 manage.py runserver on macos and then go to the link generated    
OR 
IF YOU DONT WANT TO RUN THE APP AND JUST SEE SCREENSHOTS  You can see the applications in **ApplicationScreenShots** Folder.
